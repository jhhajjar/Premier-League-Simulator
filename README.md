# Premier-League-Simulator
A simulator of a Barclays Premier League season.

### Background ###
This is a project I came up with in high school my senior year after having completed all three programming courses at my school. The project was written in Eclipse, and it prints to the console.

### How it works ###
The simulator works in that each team is given an arbitrary rank between 1 and 4, the best teams being 1, the worst teams being 4. The teams then simulate playing each other via a set probability of the amount of goals scored based on their rank and the rank of team they are playing. The probabilities are arbitrary in that they are not supported by data but rather an intuitive sense of how the games should work out. The matches for each week are printed out and the end of the season table is printed at the end.
